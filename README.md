Bubble Simulation Project by Tong Zhou, Xinyu Deng
main.py has a few updates, trying to simulate surface colors
The newest on-working version is in alter_main.py which produces a bubble with some surface white strips. Those white strips are supposed to be colorful, rainbow-like patterns.
tester.py has a heavily colored bubble. It's used as a referrence to fix current code
render.py is another tester files where I copied main.py and add some code without disturbing the main.py. It's for animation but currently, it fails to draw anything.
